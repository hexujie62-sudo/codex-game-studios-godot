# Create Architecture

This skill produces `docs/architecture/architecture.md` — the master architecture
document that translates all approved GDDs into a concrete technical blueprint.
It sits between design and implementation, and must exist before sprint planning begins.

**Absorbed responsibilities:** this Skill now also covers the former
`architecture-decision`, `architecture-review`, and `create-control-manifest`
routes. Use it to create ADRs, audit architecture coverage, and generate the
flat implementation control manifest when the blueprint is ready.

Preserved CCGS value:

- Architecture output: `docs/architecture/architecture.md`.
- ADR outputs: `docs/architecture/adr-NNNN-[slug].md`.
- Traceability outputs: `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` and
  `docs/architecture/architecture-traceability.md`.
- Control manifest output: `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`.
- ADR status values: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded`, `Rejected`.
- Every implementation-facing story should trace to a GDD requirement ID and an
  Accepted ADR or an explicit architecture concern.
- Architecture review must detect missing TR coverage, conflicting ADRs,
  dependency ordering problems, stale ADRs after GDD changes, and Godot version
  compatibility risks.
- Godot-only architecture concerns: node ownership, scene boundaries, autoload
  usage, signal/event flow, Resource/data layout, save data format, import
  pipeline, GDScript/C# boundary if any, and headless test/export constraints.
- Do not reintroduce Unity/Unreal engine-selection logic. If a template mentions
  other engines, treat it as historical reference and translate the decision
  into Godot terms.

## Reference Loading Rules

Do not read `.agents/skills-archive/` during normal use. Old architecture Skill
content has been extracted into `references/adr-review-control.md`.

Read that reference for ADR authoring, architecture coverage review,
traceability review, control-manifest generation, stale ADR checks, or
Godot-specific risk review. Full architecture blueprint authoring can run from
this `SKILL.md` alone once GDDs and technical preferences exist.

Do not parse review mode arguments and do not read or create
`production/review-mode.txt`. Use the fixed review standard: internal
architecture checks here, architecture review through this Skill when requested,
and phase-gate director review only in `/gate-check`.

## Phase -1: Classify Architecture Task

Do not require the user to remember old command names or mode parameters.
Classify the request from natural language:

- **Architecture blueprint**: create or update `docs/architecture/architecture.md`.
- **ADR authoring**: create or retrofit `docs/architecture/adr-NNNN-[slug].md`.
- **Architecture review**: check TR coverage, ADR conflicts, stale decisions,
  Godot compatibility, and traceability.
- **Control manifest**: generate or update
  `docs/architecture/control-manifest.md`.
- **Godot risk review**: inspect a specific Godot API/domain risk against the
  pinned engine reference.

If the user used an absorbed legacy name (`architecture-decision`,
`architecture-review`, or `create-control-manifest`), run the matching internal
path here and report the current command as `/create-architecture`.

For ADR, review, traceability, stale ADR, or control-manifest work, load
`references/adr-review-control.md` before drafting. For full blueprint authoring,
this `SKILL.md` is sufficient after loading project context.

---

## Phase 0: Load All Context

Before anything else, load the full project context in this order:

### 0a. Engine Context (Critical)

Read the engine reference library completely:

1. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/VERSION.md`
   → Extract: engine name, version, LLM cutoff, post-cutoff risk levels
2. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/breaking-changes.md`
   → Extract: all HIGH and MEDIUM risk changes
3. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/deprecated-apis.md`
   → Extract: APIs to avoid
4. `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/current-best-practices.md`
   → Extract: post-cutoff best practices that differ from training data
5. All files in `docs/engine-reference/[engine]/modules/`
   → Extract: current API patterns per domain

If no engine is configured, stop and prompt:
> "No engine is configured. Run `/setup-engine` first. Architecture cannot be
> written without knowing which engine and version you are targeting."

### 0b. Design Context + Technical Requirements Extraction

Read all approved design documents and extract technical requirements from each:

1. `design/gdd/game-concept.md` — game pillars, genre, core loop
2. `design/gdd/systems-index.md` — all systems, dependencies, priority tiers
3. `.codex/docs/technical-preferences.md` — naming conventions, performance budgets,
   allowed libraries, forbidden patterns
4. **Every GDD in `design/gdd/`** — for each, extract technical requirements:
   - Data structures implied by the game rules
   - Performance constraints stated or implied
   - Engine capabilities the system requires
   - Cross-system communication patterns (what talks to what, how)
   - State that must persist (save/load implications)
   - Threading or timing requirements

Build a **Technical Requirements Baseline** — a flat list of all extracted
requirements across all GDDs, numbered `TR-[gdd-slug]-[NNN]`. This is the
complete set of what the architecture must cover. Present it as:

```
## Technical Requirements Baseline
Extracted from [N] GDDs | [X] total requirements

| Req ID | GDD | System | Requirement | Domain |
|--------|-----|--------|-------------|--------|
| TR-combat-001 | combat.md | Combat | Hitbox detection per-frame | Physics |
| TR-combat-002 | combat.md | Combat | Combo state machine | Core |
| TR-inventory-001 | inventory.md | Inventory | Item persistence | Save/Load |
```

This baseline feeds into every subsequent phase. No GDD requirement should be
left without an architectural decision to support it by the end of this session.

### 0c. Existing Architecture Decisions

Read all files in `docs/architecture/` to understand what has already been decided.
List any ADRs found and their domains.

### 0d. Generate Knowledge Gap Inventory

Before proceeding, display a structured summary:

```
## Engine Knowledge Gap Inventory
Engine: [name + version]
LLM Training Covers: up to approximately [version]
Post-Cutoff Versions: [list]

### HIGH RISK Domains (must verify against engine reference before deciding)
- [Domain]: [Key changes]

### MEDIUM RISK Domains (verify key APIs)
- [Domain]: [Key changes]

### LOW RISK Domains (in training data, likely reliable)
- [Domain]: [no significant post-cutoff changes]

### Systems from GDD that touch HIGH/MEDIUM risk domains:
- [GDD system name] → [domain] → [risk level]
```

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Prompt: "One or more engine domains are HIGH RISK — the LLM's knowledge may be unreliable for these areas. Architectural recommendations in these domains should be cross-referenced with the engine docs before being acted on. How would you like to proceed?"
- Options:
  - `[A] Proceed — flag HIGH RISK domains throughout the output`
  - `[B] Let me check the engine reference first — pause here`
  - `[C] Show me which domains are HIGH RISK and why`

---

## Phase 1: System Layer Mapping

Map every system from `systems-index.md` into an architecture layer. The standard
game architecture layers are:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PRESENTATION LAYER                         │  ← UI, HUD, menus, VFX, audio
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FEATURE LAYER                              │  ← gameplay systems, AI, quests
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CORE LAYER                                 │  ← physics, input, combat, movement
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FOUNDATION LAYER                           │  ← engine integration, save/load,
│                                             │    scene management, event bus
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PLATFORM LAYER                             │  ← OS, hardware, engine API surface
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

For each GDD system, ask:
- Which layer does it belong to?
- What are its module boundaries?
- What does it own exclusively? (data, state, behaviour)

Present the proposed layer assignment and ask for approval before proceeding to
the next section. Write the approved layer map immediately to the skeleton file.

**Engine awareness check**: For each system assigned to the Core and Foundation
layers, flag if it touches a HIGH or MEDIUM risk engine domain. Show the relevant
engine reference excerpt inline.

---

## Phase 2: Module Ownership Map

For each module defined in Phase 1, define ownership:

- **Owns**: what data and state this module is solely responsible for
- **Exposes**: what other modules may read or call
- **Consumes**: what it reads from other modules
- **Engine APIs used**: which specific engine classes/nodes/signals this module
  calls directly (with version and risk level noted)

Format as a table per layer, then as an ASCII dependency diagram.

**Engine awareness check**: For every engine API listed, verify against the
relevant module reference doc. If an API is post-cutoff, flag it:

```
⚠️  [ClassName.method()] — Godot 4.6 (post-cutoff, HIGH risk)
    Verified against: docs/engine-reference/godot/modules/[domain].md
    Behaviour confirmed: [yes / NEEDS VERIFICATION]
```

Get user approval on the ownership map before writing.

---

## Phase 3: Data Flow

Define how data moves between modules during key game scenarios. Cover at minimum:

1. **Frame update path**: Input → Core systems → State → Rendering
2. **Event/signal path**: How systems communicate without tight coupling
3. **Save/load path**: What state is serialised, which module owns serialisation
4. **Initialisation order**: Which modules must boot before others

Use ASCII sequence diagrams where helpful. For each data flow:
- Name the data being transferred
- Identify the producer and consumer
- State whether this is synchronous call, signal/event, or shared state
- Flag any data flows that cross thread boundaries

Get user approval per scenario before writing.

---

## Phase 4: API Boundaries

Define the public contracts between modules. For each boundary:

- What is the interface a module exposes to the rest of the system?
- What are the entry points (functions/signals/properties)?
- What invariants must callers respect?
- What must the module guarantee to callers?

Write in pseudocode or the project's actual language (from technical preferences).
These become the contracts programmers implement against.

**Engine awareness check**: If any interface uses engine-specific types (e.g.
`Node`, `Resource`, `Signal` in Godot), flag the version and verify the type
exists and has not changed signature in the target engine version.

---

## Phase 5: ADR Audit + Traceability Check

Review all existing ADRs from Phase 0c against both the architecture built in
Phases 1-4 AND the Technical Requirements Baseline from Phase 0b.

### ADR Quality Check

For each ADR:
- [ ] Does it have an Engine Compatibility section?
- [ ] Is the engine version recorded?
- [ ] Are post-cutoff APIs flagged?
- [ ] Does it have a "GDD Requirements Addressed" section?
- [ ] Does it conflict with the layer/ownership decisions made in this session?
- [ ] Is it still valid for the pinned engine version?

| ADR | Engine Compat | Version | GDD Linkage | Conflicts | Valid |
|-----|--------------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| ADR-0001: [title] | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | None/[conflict] | ✅/⚠️ |

### Traceability Coverage Check

Map every requirement from the Technical Requirements Baseline to existing ADRs.
For each requirement, check if any ADR's "GDD Requirements Addressed" section
or decision text covers it:

| Req ID | Requirement | ADR Coverage | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| TR-combat-001 | Hitbox detection per-frame | ADR-0003 | ✅ |
| TR-combat-002 | Combo state machine | — | ❌ GAP |

Count: X covered, Y gaps. For each gap, it becomes a **Required New ADR**.

### Required New ADRs

List all decisions made during this architecture session (Phases 1-4) that do
not yet have a corresponding ADR, PLUS all uncovered Technical Requirements.
Group by layer — Foundation first:

**Foundation Layer (must create before any coding):**
- `/create-architecture [title]` → covers: TR-[id], TR-[id]

**Core Layer:**
- `/create-architecture [title]` → covers: TR-[id]

---

## Phase 6: Missing ADR List

Based on the full architecture, produce a complete list of ADRs that should exist
but don't yet. Group by priority:

**Must have before coding starts (Foundation & Core decisions):**
- [e.g. "Scene management and scene loading strategy"]
- [e.g. "Event bus vs direct signal architecture"]

**Should have before the relevant system is built:**
- [e.g. "Inventory serialisation format"]

**Can defer to implementation:**
- [e.g. "Specific shader technique for water"]

---

## Phase 7: Write the Master Architecture Document

Once all sections are approved, write the complete document to
`docs/architecture/architecture.md`.

Display a one-paragraph summary of what the document will contain (layers, modules, data flows, ADR gaps). Then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "All sections approved. May I write the master architecture document?"
  - [A] Yes — write to `docs/architecture/architecture.md` now
  - [B] Show me the full draft inline first, then ask again
  - [C] Not yet — I have more changes to discuss

The document structure:

```markdown
# [Game Name] — Master Architecture

## Document Status
- Version: [N]
- Last Updated: [date]
- Engine: [name + version]
- GDDs Covered: [list]
- ADRs Referenced: [list]

```

---

## Phase 7b: Technical Director Sign-Off + Lead Programmer Feasibility Review

After writing the master architecture document, perform an explicit sign-off before handoff.

**Step 1 — Technical Director self-review** (this skill runs as technical-director):

Apply **TD-ARCHITECTURE** as an internal self-review. Check the criteria from
`.codex/docs/director-gates.md` against the completed document without spawning
another gate.

`LP-FEASIBILITY` is not invoked as a separate gate. Do not spawn the lead
programmer here; use the internal feasibility checklist below before Phase 8
handoff.

**Step 2 — Internal feasibility checklist:**

- Each high-risk GDD requirement has either an Accepted ADR, a Proposed ADR, or
  an explicit architecture concern.
- Godot node/resource/autoload decisions are implementable with the pinned
  version.
- Control manifest ownership is clear enough for `/dev-story`.
- Known gaps are listed as ADR follow-ups rather than hidden.

**Step 3 — Present the assessments to the user:**

Show the Technical Director self-review and feasibility checklist side by side.

Use `AskUserQuestion` — "Architecture self-review is complete. How would you like to proceed?"
Options: `Accept — proceed to handoff` / `Revise flagged items first` / `Discuss specific concerns`

**Step 4 — Record sign-off in the architecture document:**

Update the Document Status section:
```
- Technical Director Sign-Off: [date] — APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS
- Lead Programmer Feasibility: FEASIBLE / CONCERNS ACCEPTED / REVISED
```

Show the proposed Document Status block inline, then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "May I update the Document Status section with the sign-off results?"
  - [A] Yes — apply to `docs/architecture/architecture.md`
  - [B] Not yet — I want to revisit the concerns first

---

## Phase 8: Handoff

**Step 1 — Update session state**: Write a summary to `production/session-state/active.md` covering: artifact written, TD/LP sign-off verdicts, any blockers, required ADRs remaining, and next step.

**Step 2 — Output the handoff** using exactly this template (no freeform prose, no rephrasing of section titles):

---

## Architecture Complete

`docs/architecture/architecture.md` v1.0 — [TD verdict: APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CONCERNS / CONCERNS]. [One sentence on what the architecture covers.]

---

## Run These ADRs Next

**1. `/create-architecture "[Title]"` → ADR-[XXXX]**
[One sentence: what it defines and what it unblocks.]

**2. `/create-architecture "[Title]"` → ADR-[XXXX]**
[One sentence.]

**3. `/create-architecture "[Title]"` → ADR-[XXXX]**
[One sentence.]

List top 3 from Phase 6 in priority order. If fewer than 3 remain, list only what's outstanding.

---

## Gate-Check Readiness

> **Required before `/gate-check [stage]`:**
> - [ ] Accept ADRs: [list Proposed ADR IDs that must be Accepted]
> - [ ] Write ADRs: [list ADR IDs that must still be written]
> - [ ] Run `/setup-engine` — verifies or scaffolds the minimal Godot test foundation
> - [ ] Run `/art-bible` — creates `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` and `design/accessibility-requirements.md`
>
> Run `/gate-check [stage]` when all boxes are checked.

If nothing is blocking, write instead:
> No blockers — run `/gate-check [stage]` now.

---

## Open Questions to Watch

| ID | Summary | Priority | Resolution Path |
|----|---------|----------|-----------------|
| QQ-XX | [short description] | High / Medium / Low | [ADR or system that resolves it] |

Omit this section entirely if there are no open QQs.

---

(End of handoff. Do not add trailing commentary after the closing rule.)

---

## Collaborative Protocol

This skill follows the collaborative design principle at every phase:

1. **Load context silently** — do not narrate file reads
2. **Present findings** — show the knowledge gap inventory and layer proposals
3. **Ask before deciding** — present options for each architectural choice
4. **Draft before approval** — show the content inline before asking to write it.
   Never ask approval for a section the user has not yet seen.
5. **Use `AskUserQuestion` for write approvals** — plain text "May I?" is not
   sufficient. Use the structured tool with labeled options [A]/[B]/[C] (write now /
   show full draft first / not yet). For multi-file changesets, list every file
   and what changes, then ask once grouped — not separate plain-text asks per file.
6. **Incremental writing** — write each approved section immediately; do not
   accumulate everything and write at the end. This survives session crashes.

Never make a binding architectural decision without user input. If the user is
unsure, present 2-4 options with pros/cons before asking them to decide.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

- Run `/create-architecture [title]` for each required ADR listed in Phase 6 — Foundation layer ADRs first
- Run `/create-architecture` — bootstraps the Requirements Traceability Matrix and TR registry from the ADRs just written. Required before the Pre-Production gate.
- Run `/setup-engine` to verify or scaffold the minimal Godot test foundation (required for gate-check)
- Run `/art-bible` to initialize `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` and `design/accessibility-requirements.md` (required for gate-check)
- Run `/create-architecture` once the required ADRs are written to produce the layer rules manifest
- Run `/gate-check pre-production` when required ADRs, `/setup-engine`, `/art-bible`, architecture traceability, and the control manifest are complete
