# Game Studio Agent Architecture -- Quick Start Guide

## What Is This?

This is a complete Codex agent architecture for game development. It
organizes 49 specialized AI agents into a studio hierarchy that mirrors
real game development teams, with defined responsibilities, delegation
rules, and coordination protocols. It includes engine-specialist agents
for Godot, Unity, and Unreal — each with dedicated sub-specialists for
major engine subsystems. All design agents and templates are grounded in
established game design theory (MDA Framework, Self-Determination Theory,
Flow State, Bartle Player Types). Use whichever engine set matches your project.

## How to Use

### 1. Understand the Hierarchy

There are three tiers of agents:

- **Tier 1 (Opus)**: Directors who make high-level decisions
  - `creative-director` -- vision and creative conflict resolution
  - `technical-director` -- architecture and technology decisions
  - `producer` -- scheduling, coordination, and risk management

- **Tier 2 (Sonnet)**: Department leads who own their domain
  - `game-designer`, `lead-programmer`, `art-director`, `audio-director`,
    `narrative-director`, `qa-lead`, `release-manager`, `localization-lead`

- **Tier 3 (Sonnet/Haiku)**: Specialists who execute within their domain
  - Designers, programmers, artists, writers, testers, engineers

### 2. Pick the Right Agent for the Job

Ask yourself: "What department would handle this in a real studio?"

| I need to... | Use this agent |
|-------------|---------------|
| Design a new mechanic | `game-designer` |
| Write combat code | `gameplay-programmer` |
| Create a shader | `technical-artist` |
| Write dialogue | `writer` |
| Plan the next sprint | `producer` |
| Review code quality | `lead-programmer` |
| Write test cases | `qa-tester` |
| Design a level | `level-designer` |
| Fix a performance problem | `performance-analyst` |
| Set up CI/CD | `devops-engineer` |
| Design a loot table | `economy-designer` |
| Resolve a creative conflict | `creative-director` |
| Make an architecture decision | `technical-director` |
| Manage a release | `release-manager` |
| Prepare strings for translation | `localization-lead` |
| Test a mechanic idea quickly | `prototyper` |
| Review code for security issues | `security-engineer` |
| Check accessibility compliance | `accessibility-specialist` |
| Get Unreal Engine advice | `unreal-specialist` |
| Get Unity advice | `unity-specialist` |
| Get Godot advice | `godot-specialist` |
| Design GAS abilities/effects | `ue-gas-specialist` |
| Define BP/C++ boundaries | `ue-blueprint-specialist` |
| Implement UE replication | `ue-replication-specialist` |
| Build UMG/CommonUI widgets | `ue-umg-specialist` |
| Design DOTS/ECS architecture | `unity-dots-specialist` |
| Write Unity shaders/VFX | `unity-shader-specialist` |
| Manage Addressable assets | `unity-addressables-specialist` |
| Build UI Toolkit/UGUI screens | `unity-ui-specialist` |
| Write idiomatic GDScript | `godot-gdscript-specialist` |
| Write Godot C# code | `godot-csharp-specialist` |
| Create Godot shaders | `godot-shader-specialist` |
| Build GDExtension modules | `godot-gdextension-specialist` |
| Plan live events and seasons | `live-ops-designer` |
| Write patch notes for players | `community-manager` |
| Brainstorm a new game idea | Use `/brainstorm` skill |

### 3. Use Slash Commands for Common Tasks

The visible command set is intentionally small. Older CCGS micro-skills are
folded into these core entries and routed through
`.codex/docs/skill-route-index.yaml`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/start` | New project, existing project adoption, or full re-orientation |
| `/help` | Read current project state and recommend one next step |
| `/window-ccgs` | Start, recover, update, audit, or compact multi-window lanes |
| `/skill-create-ccgs` | Create, merge, modify, delete, route, and test CCGS Skills |
| `/setup-engine` | Pin Godot version, language, tools, and engine references |
| `/brainstorm` | Shape game concept, pillars, loop, and prototype direction |
| `/design-system` | Systems map, GDDs, light design, review, consistency, and balance |
| `/art-bible` | Visual identity, asset specs, asset audit, UX specs, and UX review |
| `/create-architecture` | Architecture document, ADRs, architecture review, and control manifest |
| `/sprint-plan` | Epics, stories, estimates, sprint plans, scope, status, and retrospectives |
| `/dev-story` | Implement a ready story with a small readiness preflight |
| `/story-done` | Verify acceptance criteria, deviations, and test evidence |
| `/code-review` | Review code quality, architecture drift, security, tech debt, and performance |
| `/smoke-check` | QA plan, smoke tests, regression, flaky tests, playtest, and soak evidence |
| `/bug-report` | Bug report, triage, and hotfix routing |
| `/gate-check` | Phase gate, milestone, and vertical-slice readiness judgement |
| `/release-checklist` | Release, launch, changelog, patch notes, localization, and day-one patch |

See `.codex/docs/skills-reference.md` for the compact command reference.

### 4. Use Templates for New Documents

Templates are in `.codex/docs/templates/`:

- `game-design-document.md` -- for new mechanics and systems
- `architecture-decision-record.md` -- for technical decisions
- `architecture-traceability.md` -- maps GDD requirements to ADRs to story IDs
- `risk-register-entry.md` -- for new risks
- `narrative-character-sheet.md` -- for new characters
- `test-plan.md` -- for feature test plans
- `sprint-plan.md` -- for sprint planning
- `milestone-definition.md` -- for new milestones
- `level-design-document.md` -- for new levels
- `game-pillars.md` -- for core design pillars
- `art-bible.md` -- for visual style reference
- `technical-design-document.md` -- for per-system technical designs
- `post-mortem.md` -- for project/milestone retrospectives
- `sound-bible.md` -- for audio style reference
- `release-checklist-template.md` -- for platform release checklists
- `changelog-template.md` -- for player-facing patch notes
- `release-notes.md` -- for player-facing release notes
- `incident-response.md` -- for live incident response playbooks
- `game-concept.md` -- for initial game concepts (MDA, SDT, Flow, Bartle)
- `pitch-document.md` -- for pitching the game to stakeholders

- `project-stage-report.md` -- for project stage detection output
- `design-doc-from-implementation.md` -- for reverse-documenting existing code into GDDs
- `architecture-doc-from-code.md` -- for reverse-documenting code into architecture docs
- `concept-doc-from-prototype.md` -- for reverse-documenting prototypes into concept docs
- `ux-spec.md` -- for per-screen UX specifications (layout zones, states, events)
- `hud-design.md` -- for whole-game HUD philosophy, zones, and element specs
- `accessibility-requirements.md` -- for project-wide accessibility tier and feature matrix
- `interaction-pattern-library.md` -- for standard UI controls and game-specific patterns
- `player-journey.md` -- for 6-phase emotional arc and retention hooks by time scale
- `difficulty-curve.md` -- for difficulty axes, onboarding ramp, and cross-system interactions
- `test-evidence.md` -- template for recording manual test evidence (screenshots, walkthrough notes)

Also in `.codex/docs/templates/collaborative-protocols/` (used by agents, not typically edited directly):

- `design-agent-protocol.md` -- question-options-draft-approval cycle for design agents
- `implementation-agent-protocol.md` -- story pickup through /story-done cycle for programming agents
- `leadership-agent-protocol.md` -- cross-department delegation and escalation for director-tier agents

### 5. Follow the Coordination Rules

1. Work flows down the hierarchy: Directors -> Leads -> Specialists
2. Conflicts escalate up the hierarchy
3. Cross-department work is coordinated by the `producer`
4. Agents do not modify files outside their domain without delegation
5. All decisions are documented

## First Steps for a New Project

**Don't know where to begin?** Run `/start`. It asks where you are and routes
you to the right workflow. No assumptions about your game, engine, or experience level.

If you already know what you need, jump directly to the relevant path:

### Path A: "I have no idea what to build"

1. **Run `/start`** (or `/brainstorm open`) — guided creative exploration:
   what excites you, what you've played, your constraints
   - Generates 3 concepts, helps you pick one, defines core loop and pillars
   - Produces a game concept document and recommends an engine
2. **Set up the engine** — Run `/setup-engine` (uses the brainstorm recommendation)
   - Configures AGENTS.md, detects knowledge gaps, populates reference docs
   - Creates `.codex/docs/technical-preferences.md` with naming conventions,
     performance budgets, and engine-specific defaults
   - If the engine version is newer than the LLM's training data, it fetches
     current docs from the web so agents suggest correct APIs
3. **Validate the concept** — Run `/design-system design/gdd/game-concept.md`
4. **Decompose into systems** — Run `/design-system` to map all systems and dependencies
5. **Design each system** — Run `/design-system [system-name]` (or `/design-system next`)
   to write GDDs in dependency order
6. **Prototype the mechanic** — Run `/brainstorm [core-mechanic]` (1–3 days — before writing GDDs)
7. **Design each system** — Run `/design-system [system-name]` to write GDDs, informed by prototype findings
8. **Plan the first sprint** — After architecture and `/sprint-plan`, run `/sprint-plan new`
9. Start building

### Path B: "I know what I want to build"

If you already have a game concept and engine choice:

1. **Set up the engine** — Run `/setup-engine [engine] [version]`
   (e.g., `/setup-engine godot 4.6`) — also creates technical preferences
2. **Write the Game Pillars** — delegate to `creative-director`
3. **Decompose into systems** — Run `/design-system` to enumerate systems and dependencies
4. **Design each system** — Run `/design-system [system-name]` for GDDs in dependency order
5. **Create the initial ADR** — Run `/create-architecture`
6. **Create the first milestone** in `production/milestones/`
7. **Plan the first sprint** — Run `/sprint-plan new`
8. Start building

### Path C: "I know the game but not the engine"

If you have a concept but don't know which engine fits:

1. **Run `/setup-engine`** with no arguments — it will ask about your game's
   needs (2D/3D, platforms, team size, language preferences) and recommend
   an engine based on your answers
2. Follow Path B from step 2 onward

### Path D: "I have an existing project"

If you have design docs, prototypes, or code already:

1. **Run `/start`** (or `/help`) — analyzes what exists,
   identifies gaps, and recommends next steps
2. **Run `/start`** if you have existing GDDs, ADRs, or stories — audits
   internal format compliance and builds a numbered migration plan to fill gaps
   without overwriting your existing work
3. **Configure engine if needed** — Run `/setup-engine` if not yet configured
4. **Validate phase readiness** — Run `/gate-check` to see where you stand
5. **Plan the next sprint** — Run `/sprint-plan new`
