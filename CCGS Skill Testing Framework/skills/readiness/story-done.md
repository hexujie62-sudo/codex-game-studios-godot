# Skill Test Spec: /story-done

## Skill Summary

`/story-done` closes the loop between design and implementation. Run at the
end of implementing a story, it reads the story file and verifies each
acceptance criterion against the implementation. It checks for GDD and ADR
deviations, prompts a code review, updates the story status to `Complete`,
logs any tech debt, and surfaces the next ready story from the sprint. It
produces a COMPLETE / COMPLETE WITH NOTES / BLOCKED verdict and writes to
the story file and optionally to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`.

## Static Assertions (Structural)

Verified automatically by `/skill-create-ccgs` internal static check — no fixture needed.

- [ ] Has required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`
- [ ] Has ≥5 phase headings (complex skill warranting `context: fork` if applicable)
- [ ] Contains verdict keywords: COMPLETE, BLOCKED
- [ ] Contains "May I write" collaborative protocol language (writes to story file and tech-debt register)
- [ ] Has a next-step handoff (surfaces next story from sprint)

## Test Cases

### Case 1: Happy Path — All acceptance criteria met, no deviations

**Fixture:**
- Story file at `production/epics/core/story-light-pickup.md` with:
  - 3 acceptance criteria, all implemented as described
  - `TR-ID: TR-light-001` referencing a GDD requirement
  - `ADR: docs/architecture/adr-003-inventory.md` (Accepted)
  - `Status: In Progress`
- Implementation files listed in story exist in `src/`
- GDD requirement text at TR-light-001 matches how the feature was implemented
- ADR guidance was followed (no deviations)

**Input:** `/story-done production/epics/core/story-light-pickup.md`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill reads the story file and extracts all key fields
2. Skill reads the GDD requirement fresh from `tr-registry.yaml` (not from story's quoted text)
3. Skill reads the referenced ADR to understand implementation constraints
4. Skill evaluates each acceptance criterion (auto where possible, manual prompt where not)
5. Skill checks for GDD requirement deviations
6. Skill checks for ADR guideline deviations
7. Skill prompts user: "Please provide the code review outcome for this story"
8. Skill presents COMPLETE verdict
9. Skill asks "May I update story Status to Complete and add Completion Notes?"
10. If yes: skill updates the story file
11. Skill surfaces the next `Ready for Dev` story from the sprint

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Skill reads `docs/architecture/tr-registry.yaml` for TR-ID requirement text (not just story)
- [ ] Skill reads the referenced ADR file (not just the story reference)
- [ ] Each acceptance criterion is listed with VERIFIED / DEFERRED / FAILED status
- [ ] Skill prompts the user for code review outcome (does not skip this step)
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE when all criteria are verified and no deviations exist
- [ ] Skill asks "May I write" before updating the story file
- [ ] Skill does NOT auto-update story status without user confirmation
- [ ] After completion, skill surfaces the next ready story from `production/sprints/`

---

### Case 2: Blocked Path — Acceptance criterion cannot be verified

**Fixture:**
- Story file has an acceptance criterion: "Player sees correct animation on pickup"
- No automated test for this criterion exists
- Manual verification has not been performed
- All other criteria are met

**Input:** `/story-done production/epics/core/story-light-pickup.md`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill processes all acceptance criteria
2. Reaches the animation criterion — cannot auto-verify
3. Skill asks the user: "Acceptance criterion 'Player sees correct animation on
   pickup' cannot be auto-verified. Has this been manually tested?"
4. If user says No: criterion is marked DEFERRED, verdict becomes COMPLETE WITH NOTES
5. Skill records the deferred criterion in completion notes
6. Asks "May I write updated story with deferred criterion noted?"

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Skill asks the user about unverifiable criteria rather than assuming PASS
- [ ] Deferred criteria result in COMPLETE WITH NOTES (not COMPLETE or BLOCKED)
- [ ] The deferred criterion is explicitly named in the completion notes
- [ ] Skill still asks "May I write" before updating the story file

---

### Case 3: Blocked Path — GDD deviation detected

**Fixture:**
- Story TR-ID points to requirement: "Player can carry max 3 light sources"
- Implementation in `src/` uses a variable `MAX_CARRIED_LIGHTS = 5`
- This is a deliberate deviation from the GDD

**Input:** `/story-done production/epics/core/story-light-pickup.md`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill reads the GDD requirement text (max 3)
2. Skill detects discrepancy between requirement and implementation value (5)
3. Skill flags this as a GDD deviation and asks the user to classify it:
   - INTENTIONAL: document the deviation and reason
   - ERROR: implementation must be fixed before story can be marked Complete
   - OUT OF SCOPE: requirement changed and GDD needs updating
4. If INTENTIONAL: skill records deviation in completion notes, verdict is COMPLETE WITH NOTES
5. If ERROR: verdict is BLOCKED until implementation is corrected

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Skill detects the mismatch between GDD requirement and implementation value
- [ ] Skill asks the user to classify the deviation (not auto-assumes either way)
- [ ] INTENTIONAL deviation → COMPLETE WITH NOTES (not BLOCKED)
- [ ] ERROR deviation → BLOCKED verdict until fixed
- [ ] Detected deviations are recorded in completion notes or tech debt register

---

### Case 4: Edge Case — No argument, auto-detect current story

**Fixture:**
- `production/session-state/active.md` contains a reference to
  `production/epics/core/story-oxygen-drain.md` as the active story
- That story file exists with `Status: In Progress`

**Input:** `/story-done` (no argument)

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill reads `production/session-state/active.md`
2. Skill finds the active story reference
3. Skill reads that story file and proceeds normally
4. Output confirms which story was auto-detected

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Skill reads `production/session-state/active.md` when no argument is given
- [ ] Skill identifies and confirms the auto-detected story before proceeding
- [ ] If no story is found in session state, skill asks the user to provide a path

---

---

### Case 5: Code Review Prompt — fixed Lean policy

**Fixture:**
- Story file at `production/epics/core/story-light-pickup.md`
- All acceptance criteria verified, no GDD deviations
- No `production/review-mode.txt` or `production/session-state/review-mode.txt`
  exists

**Input:** `/story-done production/epics/core/story-light-pickup.md`

**Expected behavior:**
1. Skill does not read or create review-mode state.
2. After implementation verification, skill asks whether `/code-review` was run.
3. Code review status is recorded in completion notes.
4. Missing code review remains advisory unless acceptance criteria, evidence, or
   deviation checks are blocking.
5. Skill still asks "May I write" before updating story status.

**Assertions:**
- [ ] No review-mode file is read or required.
- [ ] LP-CODE-REVIEW gate is not spawned.
- [ ] Code review is prompted and recorded as Pending / Complete / Skipped.
- [ ] Missing code review alone does not block a COMPLETE WITH NOTES verdict.
- [ ] Skill still requires "May I write" approval before marking story Complete.

---

## Protocol Compliance

- [ ] Uses "May I write" before updating the story file
- [ ] Uses "May I write" before adding entries to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`
- [ ] Presents complete findings (criteria check, deviation check) before asking approval
- [ ] Ends by surfacing the next ready story and recommending `/window-ccgs checkpoint B-dev` when completion changes are rollback-sized
- [ ] Does not mark a story Complete if any criteria are in ERROR state
- [ ] Does not skip the code review prompt

---

## Coverage Notes

- The full 8-phase flow of the skill is exercised across Cases 1-3; not all
  edge cases within each phase are covered.
- Tech debt logging (deferred items written to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`)
  is mentioned in Case 2 but not the primary assertion focus; dedicated
  coverage deferred.
- The `sprint-status.yaml` update (Phase 7 in the skill) is implied by Case 1
  but not the primary assertion; assumed to follow the same "May I write" pattern.
- Stories with multiple TR-IDs or multiple ADRs are not explicitly tested.
